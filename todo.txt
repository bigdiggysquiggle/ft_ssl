** fix password hashing
** -I think I've cracked password and salt use
** --core algorithm is great. restructure so that base64 encrypting post des
**   happens before going through algorithm on decrypt and after on encrypt
**   grabbing salt for decryption happens post base64 decrypt
** ---this also allows for salt management pre algorithm
 password flag segfaults when it's the last flag!
 -problem is in the j_increment where it calls a strdup

** on encrypt, if salt is used remember to append "Salted__" + salt to the
** beginning of the file

 redo get_missing in missing.c to only grab missing items on encryption
 and decide conditions for getting missing data on decrypt

 change all the algorithms to read straight from the fd in question if applicable
 - restructure code to allow block by block reading and encrypting

 refactor flag parsing (low priority)
