find a way to check stdin for input without changing it to non-blocking behaviour

--make sure des with base64 doesn't print extra new lines

refactor flag parsing (high priority)
--when key is given, ignore key from pass
--when salt is given always append to front
---but only append "Salted__" when pass flag is present
---verify how openssl reacts to incorrect salt on decrypt
---when salt is passed via flag, pad back with 0, not front

md5 currently does nothing with echo -n, openssl does

consider implementing whirlpool

add des3-ecb and des3-cbc

hexdump -C

2 ^ n - 1

"Great work on DES and the code of preprocessing and handling the
errors and edges case was all located in the front part so he could
only care about the correct inputs when he need to apply encryption
and hashing and this is smart. Some parts there should be
improvements.
1. handling with echo -n | ./ft_ssl md5
2. echo -n | ./ft_ssl - using some NULL there are some edges cases
   I don't remember :)
3. echo -n asdf | ./ft_ssl -p -k -s a - salt handling got reversed
4. handling flags -e works -eee correctly throw error but -ee -ez
   -ep doens't
5. Salted header only used when there is password flag
6. base64 works great. But base64 at DES adds extra new lines ...
   In the counterpart he understands the core concept clearly and
   knows correctly. There is some issues with his code but he knows
how to handle it and as far as he could pass most of more than
99% of cases good to go. But still some critical problem should
be handled. Good luck."
