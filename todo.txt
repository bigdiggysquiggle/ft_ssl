 block length isn't being read properly

 consider a flag check for print_base64 usage in des printing

 change all the algorithms to read straight from the fd in question if applicable
 - restructure code to allow block by block reading and encrypting

 make sure that -a flag doesn't cause des to use the base64 encrypted input's length

 refactor flag parsing (low priority)

 add des3-ecb and des3-cbc

 optimize base64 decryption by having strip_nl modify the stored length as part
 of the strip process
